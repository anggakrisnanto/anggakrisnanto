### <summary><strong>Yosh!</strong></summary>
<p>
    I am a front-end developer with 5 years of professional experience, skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition to my front-end expertise, I have successfully completed multiple full-stack projects, demonstrating my comprehensive understanding of both client-side and server-side development.

    I interned for three months at INTERNETSLIM, where I gained valuable industry experience and practical knowledge. In 2021, I earned a certification in Application Programming from LSP, achieving Indonesian National Qualification Framework Level II on Skills Competence Software Engineering.

    I am passionate about crafting intuitive and engaging web experiences and am continuously seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and contribute to innovative projects in the tech industry.
